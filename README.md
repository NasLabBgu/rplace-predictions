# r/place Prediction

This repository contains most of the code used to build different engagment predictions models. The engagment is based on **Community** level. We rely on the r/place social experiment that took place on April 2017. The fulll research description and modeling process is propsed in the following paper:

Communities in a Large-scale Distributed Campaign](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05334.pdf). Abraham Israeli, Alexander Kremiansky, Oren Tsur

## r/place Resources
* **Wikipedia Page:** A wiki page describing the experiment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit)
* **Experiment Video:** A fast-forward video of the 72-hours timelapse of the experiment:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRCZK3KjUY
* **Subreddit:** The r/place subreddit in Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/place/

## Code 
Most of the code that was used to load data and train the models is under two folders:

*  **data_loaders:**
A folder that contains all the code we used to load data from various sources.

* **r_place_drawing_classifier:**
A folder that contains mode of the code we userd to train the classification models.

## Data
The raw level data is taken from the open Pushift repository (https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/).
The annotated data (community level) can be found as as a csv file under the "annotated_data" name.
