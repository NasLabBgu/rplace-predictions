In order to run classification algorithms, we first need to create data for them.
We do it in a multi step process:

a. Creating the target feature Data-Frame. This is done by running the "target_feature_creation.py" file
There are a few configurations in this file (e.g., "smooth_demand_area_per_artwork") which are all explained in the file

b. Creating the SR objects for this run

c.


Color mapping
---------------
These are the colors which were used along the experiment. The index is the same as appears in our data.
